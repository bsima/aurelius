## Help out by adding quotes

I would love to have your help! So far, I've only transcribed my
favorite quotes, but there are many more Aurelius quotes that deserve
to be on this website.

[**Click here to easily & quickly submit a quote.**](https://goo.gl/forms/zivB95KX91rzcPHT2)

That link takes you to a form in Google Docs. I will see the entries
in the form and will add the quotes in my free time.

If you know a bit of code and GitHub, you can help by adding quotes
direcly to the source. The quotes are stored in
`data/marcus.json`. The format is:

- the document is a list of quotes
- each quote is a JSON object
- the `"quote"` field contains a list of strings. Each string is a
  paragraph.
- the `"book"` and `"section"` fields are integers

To submit a quote, go to [`data/marcus.json`][data] and click the
pencil icon (next to the "Raw Blame History" buttons). Then type out
your quote in the format described above and submit a Pull Request. I
will review and merge your changes as soon as I can.

If you have any questions, [open an issue][newissue] and I will
respond ASAP.
